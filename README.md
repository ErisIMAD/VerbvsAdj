# Verbs vs Adjectives

This is my first HTML project, using the basics of the basics.

## Project Description

The project consists of a single HTML file that uses the basics of HTML to demonstrate a mock grammar page.

## Project Structure

- **VerbAdj.html**: The only HTML file, containing the content and structure of the project.

## Usage

To view the project, simply open the `VerbAdj.html` file in a web browser.

## Acknowledgment

This is a practice project, and no rights are reserved, and no copyright restrictions apply. The image used in this project is sourced from [Grammar Monster](https://www.grammar-monster.com/lessons/verbs.htm).


**Note**: The input fields do not actually do anything, as I wanted to only include HTML and not use JS just yet.
